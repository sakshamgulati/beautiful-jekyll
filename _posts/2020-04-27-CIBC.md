What if you could predict the next Google, Amazon or Netflix?

Using data from Crunchbase, I created a model which used XG Boost and predicted the success of a startup with a 78% accuracy. Visit the link for more insights! Would love to connect!

I extracted data from 2000-2014 to predict which startups are going to be successful in the future. The model was trained on this data to predict the features which lead to the success of a startup.
