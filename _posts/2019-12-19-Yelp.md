Instead of surfing the web everytime looking for reviews, What if you can extract all information from Yelp about restaurants nearby and predict which ones the best based on user reviews? Instead of wishing for them to have this feature, I developed this myself.

Its exactly what I did using Yelp API and Naive Bayes Classifier.
