My name is Saksham Gulati.As a Business Analyst and Data Scientist, I regularly translate and communicate my data deep-dive results to stakeholders and clients in plain business language. I was introduced to analytics when as a naïve engineer in my sophomore undergraduate year, I tweaked a machine-learning algorithm to earn profits for my Bitcoin portfolio and I was amazed to see the real-time application of my work.


## My Learnings

#### Data Management: 
At UnitedHealth Group(UHG), I orchestrated several data-driven ad hoc analyses assignments, KPI reports, and dashboards for both clients and stakeholders; gleaning information on the key aspects of Business Intelligence and the reporting side of analytics. The most exciting work was an in-house project to build a database quality dashboard, where I amalgamated 32 disparate Oracle data sources to create a single data warehouse without disrupting daily operations and size limits. The dashboard tracked live data quality for 65+ million members over 300 aggregate metrics and identified even the slightest 1% deviations in data quality. My efforts were recognized and rewarded by UHG Directors with numerous “Bravo” awards.

#### Modeling and Predictive Analytics: 
With the CIBC Innovation Banking’s arm, I identified the success of a start-up to streamline the loan diligence process. Collaboratively, I’ve collected data from CrunchBase, an open source start-up repository, engineered XGBoost algorithm in Python to classify the success of a start-up with a 78% accuracy. One of the major caveats was dealing with missing values which could induce bias in the dataset, but by employing my creative mindset I mitigated that problem using proxy variables and imputing missing data

#### Data Storytelling: 
I make data speak and have learned the importance of how these tools convey results to end users. On average, I have used datasets with more than 10+ million rows and created numerous Excel and BI dashboards to present clear solutions. Additionally, I have participated with numerous Kaggle competitions and published dashboards on my personal Tableau Public page allowing access to my work for those needing to solve business problems

#### Client Management and Collaborative Thinking:
As a Business Analyst, I regularly translated and communicated my data deep-dive results to stakeholders and clients in plain business language. As a Data Science Intern at CIBC, I learnt that it was imperative for me to convey business objectives into analytical frameworks and interpret model insights to create business value that all stakeholders can understand.
