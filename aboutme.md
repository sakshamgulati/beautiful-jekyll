I make data speak and use data science to drive business-oriented results. 

As a full-stack Data Scientist at Rogers, I engineer end-to-end pipelines from ETL and data transformation to inferencing using Azure Machine Learning Modules. Alongside, I regularly translate and communicate my big data deep-dive results to stakeholders and clients in plain business language. I am well versed with tools and technologies such as MS Azure ML Studio, Google Cloud Platform, Databricks, Python, PySpark, Docker, Heroku, Streamlit and Streamlit. 

On my weekends, I volunteer as a Data Science Mentor and help students break into Data Science and Analytics.


## My Learnings

#### Data Management: 
At Rogers, I built and managed ETL pipelines for both development and staging branches ensuring that data sinks and sources are maintained properly. The ETL pipelines were responsible for data preprocessing and transformation on Azure Datastores. The preprocessing steps were orchestrated using Databricks on Azure and I had to maintain and upgrade pipelines for rapidly changing Spark libraries. My efforts were recognized by Leaders and I was promoted to a Manager, Data Science within a year of joining Rogers.

At UnitedHealth Group(UHG), I orchestrated several data-driven ad hoc analyses assignments, KPI reports, and dashboards for both clients and stakeholders; gleaning information on the key aspects of Business Intelligence and the reporting side of analytics. The most exciting work was an in-house project to build a database quality dashboard, where I amalgamated 32 disparate Oracle data sources to create a single data warehouse without disrupting daily operations and size limits. The dashboard tracked live data quality for 65+ million members over 300 aggregate metrics and identified even the slightest 1% deviations in data quality. My efforts were recognized and rewarded by UHG Directors with numerous “Bravo” awards.

#### Modeling and Predictive Analytics:
I dont think the fanciest models drive business value!
I have been proficient in deploying deep learning models based on Convolutional Neural Network and Natural Language Processing. Moreover, I have deployed complex machine learning models using XG Boost and ensemble methods. 

I had the opportunity to create a pet project which I would encourage you to explore - https://freshpriceprod.herokuapp.com/
With NLP, I have created models which can identify users intent with a  99% accuracy. Moreover, another NLP based model of mine was able to predict topics associated with customer churn. We developed these models out of customer transcripts.

With the CIBC Innovation Banking’s arm, I identified the success of a start-up to streamline the loan diligence process. Collaboratively, I’ve collected data from CrunchBase, an open source start-up repository, engineered XGBoost algorithm in Python to classify the success of a start-up with a 78% accuracy. One of the major caveats was dealing with missing values which could induce bias in the dataset, but by employing my creative mindset I mitigated that problem using proxy variables and imputing missing data

#### Data Storytelling: 

I make data speak and have learned the importance of how these tools convey results to end users. On average, I have used datasets with more than 10+ million rows and created numerous Excel and BI dashboards to present clear solutions. Additionally, I have participated with numerous Kaggle competitions and published dashboards on my personal Tableau Public page allowing access to my work for those needing to solve business problems

#### Client Management and Collaborative Thinking:
As Data Scientist at Rogers and Loblaw, I have had the opportunity to translate data science insights into plain business language. This helped the business drive informed decisions. I ended up providing quantifiable business value which you can find on my resume.

As a Business Analyst, I regularly translated and communicated my data deep-dive results to stakeholders and clients in plain business language. As a Data Science Intern at CIBC, I learnt that it was imperative for me to convey business objectives into analytical frameworks and interpret model insights to create business value that all stakeholders can understand.
